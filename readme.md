# Yoga App Angular/Spring Boot API Testing project

This repository houses both the Angular Frontend and the Spring Boot API backend for the Yoga App testing project. The project incorporates unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end (E2E) testing. The API is specifically crafted to collaborate with the frontend.

The primary objective of this project is to furnish a comprehensive test suite that guarantees the robustness and reliability of the application. By implementing a range of testing methodologies, including unit tests for individual components, integration tests to validate the interaction between various modules, and end-to-end tests to assess the entire system's functionality, we aim to ensure the seamless performance of the Yoga App.
